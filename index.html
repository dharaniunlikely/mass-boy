    <p>AMMA LOVE
Life of Amma: Amma’s Childhood

She was Sudhamani Amma was born in a poor fishing village in Kerala, Southern India, in 1953. Her father sold fish to make a living. Her mother relates that the child wasn’t born crying as babies usually are, but with a beaming smile on Her face. She was given the name Sudhamani (Ambrosial Jewel). Even as a small child, it was clear that She was unique. At six months She could walk and talk, and by the age of three, She was constantly singing. By the age of five, She was composing beautiful, extraordinarily profound hymns to Her beloved Krishna. Sudhamani charmed and delighted everyone around Her. But as She grew, Her divine moods, including frequent meditative states, singing, and ecstatic dancing beside the seashore, began to annoy Her family. At the early age of five Sudhamani was already subjected to severe scoldings. When Sudhamani was nine, Her mother became ill. Although Sudhamani was the brightest girl in Her class, She had to leave school and take care of Her entire family. It was a gruelling task, with seven brothers and sisters to feed and clothe, and animals to tend. She virtually became the family servant, working from before dawn till midnight.

As part of Her work, She had to collect food for the family cows. She would roam the local villages, gathering grass and visiting neighbourhood homes to ask for vegetable peels and leftover rice gruel for the cows. At times like these, She saw many things that troubled Her. She saw how some people were starving, while others had more than enough. She saw that many people were sick and suffering from intense pain, unable to afford a single painkiller. And She noticed that many of the elderly were neglected and treated harshly by their own families. Her empathy was such that the pain of others was unbearable to Her. Though just a child, She began to contemplate the question of suffering. She asked Herself, why do people suffer? What is the underlying cause of suffering? And so powerfully did She feel the presence of God within Her that She wanted to reach out and comfort and uplift those who were less fortunate than She.

In many ways, it was then that Ammas mission began. She would share Her food with the starving, and She would bathe and clothe the elderly who had no one to look after them. She was punished when She gave away the family’s food and belongings to the poor, but Sudhamani would not stop Her acts of kindness. She took refuge in the solitude of the night, spending hours meditating and fervently praying to Lord Krishna. During the day She carried his photo in Her blouse pocket and constantly sang His names. During Her early teens, udhamani was sent to the houses of relatives where She laboured for long hours, taking care of their households as well. Throughout all her duties She was incessantly singing and chanting Krishna’s name, and imagined that all the work she did was for him. Sweeping the yard, she imagined that he could arrive at any moment. As she prepared food she imagined that Krishna would appear as a guest at the table. In this way, she never resented her duties, nor the abuse her family gave her, but only prayed to be given more of the Lord’s work.

🌟 WORLD APPA
To Appa, with love

One of my earliest memories of Appa is of him as a son, not a father. There was my grandfather, very old and feeble but still a proud and obstinate man. Ajja would insist on tottering with his walking stick to our Indianstyle toilet but be left breathless after a few steps. Appa would support him firmly, sit him down on a square, bottomed-out chair, give him a bed pan and clean up after him with the minimum of fuss. Ajja, that fascinating teller of tales, had a huge brood of 18 children, but when his end was near, he chose to be with Appa, his 15th child and I daresay his dearest son. Today as I look at Appa, 80 years young but with the unmistakable visage of Ajja visited on him, that indelible recollection of his gentleness with his father overrides everything else about him. Dads come in many shapes, sizes, colours and moods. Appa was of slender build, fair and handsome (our family used to call him that much before savvy MNCs appropriated the term), his aquiline features belying his Dravidian roots. He was, and is, a charmer with his happy demeanour and sweet tongue (old-timers, including grandmothers, in his native village of Palya in Hassan district recall his pranks and peccadilloes with affection). Appa went to school, but only till SSLC. Of course, he did write an Intermediate exam successfully for his best friend, but soon decided that life’s education was best obtained outside class. He would often run away with touring drama troupes or wangle free tickets to literary convocations in remote towns. With his zest for life and ability to make friends, he was a free spirit living life on his own terms. Ajja and Ajji, with nearly a score of mouths to feed and many more issues to worry about, let him be. Anaiah (as he was called) was good with figures, and had an exquisite handwriting. He was employed as a bookkeeper with the panchayat and gave an excellent account of himself before succumbing to the follies of youth, namely drink and gambling; gin and rummy if you will. His adeptness at cards earned him high praise, but little income – whatever he won would be splurged on assorted friends, nieces and nephews. That phase soon passed and distant dreams, namely Bombay, beckoned. In the meantime, he had begun corresponding with an unknown contributor to a Kannada lit-magazine. That penfriendship slowly turned into comradeship, blossoming from a flirtatious dalliance to a life-long alliance. Appa and Amma soon made their way west, settling in a distant Bombay suburb and raising three kids, of whom I am the youngest. Life in Mumbai is a struggle for most migrants, more so for one with a family. While Amma managed her poor-paying teaching job and three kids and their sacks of demands, Appa would be hard at work trying to earn that extra rupee that would brighten our smiles when he returned home. Appa was self-taught and selfmade;all that he had learned – from modern accountancy practices to solving cryptic crosswords to dealing with high-profile clients in English-was thanks to his powers of observation and due diligence. So his joy knew no bounds when his acumen and dedication to work earned him the coveted post of Chief Accountant at Coca-Cola (that’s how the Indian franchise Pure Drinks Pvt Ltd was commonly referred to). In his middle age, Appa was plagued by chronic tuberculosis and other ailments, but he would pop a pill or take an injection and journey to office without a whine. In all my early years, I can hardly recollect him taking sick leave and lying in bed. This grit and gumption, apart from his sense of humour, stood him well through the various vicissitudes in his life, including the passing away of his parents, a dozen siblings and the death of a few cherished dreams. He was not a Gen Y dad, but was modern enough to give us kids the space we needed while making sure that he was always there when we wanted him. I can see myself, during those long, hot summer vacations, stealthily dipping into his pant pockets for a 50-paise coin or a rupee to fund my bicycle ride. If he knew, he never let on even as he indulged my excited patter about my escapades. Similarly, when in my youth, he would stumble upon a horse-racing or matka slip, he would try to steer me away from such pursuits and patiently urge me to do something with my life. In one hilarious instance, Appa and Amma had gone out of town and I had invited my cardchums over to spend a night at my empty place to booze and gamble. As 15 sozzled souls went to sleep wherever they could, the door-bell rang sharply. It was 6 am. As advised by me, the person closest to the door opened it, picked up the milk pail and thrust it at the milkman. Only, it was no milkman, but Appa! He had got a confirmed train ticket a day earlier than planned. Holding the milk pail, he stepped inside. As the home emptied of 14 bleary-eyed and terrified youngsters, I expected the roof to come crashing down. But there was not a word from Appa. He had his bath and left for work as if it was the most natural thing in the world for his son to cram the house with his friends, beer bottles and decks of cards. Similarly, during my struggle to make my career in the media, he would never let his disappointment with me show. He would always put in a cheerful word of encouragement (a news addict himself, he often stumps me with the simplest of questions regarding breaking stories about which I don’t have the foggiest). An eternal lover of women, I suspect he dotes on Amma and my sisters more than me, but that could be just my imagination. For me, Appa is simply the best four-letter palindrome a child could have. As the phone rings from Hyderabad, after enquiring about his grand-daughter, he typically turns to his next favourite topic, the crossword. “Achcha, I have one clue left unsolved. 2 Down, 6-letter word for ‘His friendship begins with a good heart’.” Father, I say.</p>
